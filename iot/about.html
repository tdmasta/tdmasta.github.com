    <h2> SENSOR &trade; <small>In a glimpse</small></h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        Sensor is TelecomDesign&trade; underlying platform in charge of 
        <ul>
            <li>Data gathering  and storage</li>
            <li>Global M2M operation management (upgrade, configuration, definition)</li>
            <li>Metrics (Technical / Business) computation </li>
            <li>Business Service Provider through DSL's remote endpoint exposition</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        
        Sensor&trade; platform has been used successfully for years in many Industrial M2M Projects, and is designed to cope with the worsts environments (poor bandwidth, scarse network, low memory / cpu consumption....)

    <h3>Live API <small>Event callback</small></h3>
    <p>
        Sensor Live API provides real time notification upon event broadcast, either to your backend in case of an application configured, either by fallback polling using Device / Application API.
        Pushing through WebSocket is under experimentation and intend to shortly become our target for both App / Device fallback, and preferred to polling (we don't like polls <strong>at all</strong>).
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h4> How does it works  ? </h4>
    
    <p>
        Live API access requires registration from you. Upon successull registration process, you get acces to Application management at dashboard level. 
        See <a href="#dashboard">Dashboard implementation</a> for more information about dashboard features implementation.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Remote API <small>standard way</small></h3>
    
    <h3>General considerations</h3>
    
    <h4>URLS</h4>
    
    <p>
        All request should be made over SSL, against the live api URL : 
        <code>https://sensor.insgroup.fr</code>
    </p>
    
    <h4>Authentication and security</h4>
    <p>
        Three API are available for <big>you</big> Hacker 
        <ul>
            <li>A <a href="#developer">developer API</a>, providing remote WS access for automated process</li>
            <li>A <a href="#device">device API</a>, with no registration requirements to access single device message history</li>
            <li>An <a href="#application">Application API</a> available upon succesfull registration operation </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
